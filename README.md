# ac-bootcamp-54-n3o-guessanumber
Project Guess a Number for &lt; Academia de CÃ³digo _>'s 54th bootcamp

In this project we had to make a simulation of a guessing game. I decided to finish it since it had errors, and I rewrote the most of it in less than an hour. In out/artifacts you'll find an executable jar to test it yourself.
