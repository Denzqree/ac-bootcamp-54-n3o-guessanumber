This project was made by Daniel Madeira during his late-2020 bootcamp @ < Academia de CÃ³digo _>.

In this project we had to make a simulation of a guessing game. I decided to finish it since it had errors, and I rewrote the most of it in less than an hour. In out/artifacts you'll find an executable jar to test it yourself.
